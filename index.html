					I want to start by apologizing for what might
					seem like a lack of effort on my part or doing bare minimum. This
					isn't just a token of appreciation; it's a heartfelt confession of my
					feelings for you. Writing this is making me blush, but it's worth it
					because I love you more than words can say.
				</p>

				<p>
					Life's thrown me a curveball lately, leaving me unable to offer grand
					gestures, any presents or physical letters. Instead, I've chosen this
					simple, sincere message by all means testament of my love for you.
					It's not easy for me to express myself like this, but my feelings are
					genuine, and I refuse to let this day pass without showing you how
					much you mean to me. As someone once said, "The best love is the kind
					that awakens the soul; that makes us reach for more, that plants the
					fire in our hearts and brings peace to our minds." That's how I feel
					about you.
				</p>

				<p>
					Despite life's challenges, I've cherished every one of the 6264 hours
					we've spent together. Each moment has been a gift, and I'm grateful
					for the time we've shared. I want you to know that my love for you is
					consistent, even in the face of adversity. From the beginning of our
					unexpected friendship and courtship, you are never been less interesting to
					me. You are more than a gift that I can ever received. As the famous
					quote goes, "In all the world, there is no heart for me like yours. In
					all the world, there is no love for you like mine." You're my
					everything, and I'm dedicated to proving that to you, today and
					always.

				<p>You represent this flower amidst all those figures in the garden; it's you whom I picked. You awaken something within me with your natural essence. I love every aspect of you, from head to toe. You captured my attention; I chose you, and I will cherish you. You are the best thing that has ever happened to my previously uninteresting, boring life. We're approaching a year of friendship and two months of love. Although I may not be able to fully express these sentiments through actions, let me express them in words for now and actions at the right time.  I value your existence. This may sound verbose and wordy, but I truly mean every word I say. Trust me when I say you are loved by me; always remember that, even when I am far away.</p>

				<p>As our relationship started from the internet, please accept this small token of appreciation of my love for you. Please accept this cute little flower, which signifies my loyalty and devotion. On this Valentine's Day, I want to express my gratitude for your presence in my life. You bring joy and warmth into every moment we share. Thank you for being the wonderful person and the light in my life. Happy Valentine's Day, my love.</p>

					I've chosen a song for you to listen to. This song reflects the essence of our connection, a piece that speaks volumes about how I feel, a melody that resonates with the depth of my emotions and affections. By sharing this song with you, I'm entrusting you with a piece of my heart, symbolizing the strength of our bond. Even if circumstances may pull us apart unexpectedly, let this song serve as a reminder of the enduring love and connection we share.
        </p>
          <p>I love you so much, my love.</p>
